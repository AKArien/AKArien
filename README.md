## Informatics, sovereignty and poetry

### whoami

Currently in my third year of studying informatics in France, i am looking to learn forever more about computers and adjacent subjects.

Why ? Though one could say my interest is bordeline maladive, i don’t just « like it ». I also believe it to be an ever-increasingly crucial domain for the foreseeable future :
- computers are important !
- informatics is a wide subject !

This wording is a short-hand for a proper essay detailing how nowadays, everything and everyone hinges on at least a computer, if not a full-blown informatic service. Not that a service cannot be one machine, but let’s not discuss the specifics too much.
Simply put, there is what feels like an infinity of things to learn.

The point is to solve problems, making a, preferably measurable, positive impact on the world.

#### Free software

Sovereignty is the dependancy of sustainability and a railguard againt abuse. At an individual scale, this can manifest through the use of free software. Wider entities are much the same, except they can rely on internal ressources as well.
While it admitedly is often a better decision to outsource some things, there is always a core of activities that need a drop-in, sovereign replacement.
This is what the school i study in, [École Hexagone](https://www.ecole-hexagone.com/fr/en/), stands for.

### whatis it\ i\ do

I like to study and make software that is « good » : efficient, user-friendly, maintainable.
Check out my code ! Especially :
- [uniKey](https://github.com/AKArien/uniKey) : firmware using an Atmel AVR microcontroller and the V-USB library, complete with a manifesto and physical conception files (uploading soon)
- [tamagotchi](https://github.com/AKArien/multi-tamagotchi) : my first big project, of making a tamagotchi-inspired game on a microcontroller. Uses plain C and arduino C++
- [wf-shell](https://github.com/AKArien/wf-shell) : the UI i currenlty work on ! Adding the features i want to see
- [malley](https://github.com/AFCMS/malley) : a school project of a social network. GPL-3, self-hostable, made to be GDPR-friendly and completely transparent.

I also take part in mainlining linux hardware from android and make scripts when i have a fun idea.

### whereis poetry

I like art. Shocking, i know.

With poetry comes a great deal of nuanced expression, usually in a few words. When thinking of the best ways to express an idea, to actually *transmit it*, i can’t help but find it not too dissimilar to writing a regex, a functionnal diagram or just a plain function.

I would define poetry as [a hack of words](https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html), and other art forms as hack of their own building bricks.
